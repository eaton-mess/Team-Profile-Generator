# Team Profile Generator

## Description 

The Team Profile Generator is a command-line application designed to streamline the process of generating a webpage that displays essential information about a software engineering team. This application allows managers to quickly gather and input information about team members, including their names, IDs, email addresses, and specific roles (such as Manager, Engineer, or Intern).

Utilising Node.js, Inquirer for user input, and Jest for unit testing, the application offers a seamless user experience. Upon running the application with the command node index.js, the user is guided through a series of prompts to input information about the team manager, engineers, and interns. Once all information is provided, the application generates an HTML webpage that neatly organises and displays the team's information.

A sample HTML page can be found here:
